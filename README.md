# PortfolioProjects
## Matlab Audio Sample
### My audio sampler project! That utilizes Matlab to create different audio functions like an Equalizer, Synthesizer, and Audio Manipulation
## Stereo Sound Detector PCB  
### My Stereo Sound Detector PCB is a project where I used the schematic to solder on different electrical components on to the PCB. Along with testing different electronics fundamentals like buffer filters, alternate amplifiers, and low pass filter!
## STM32 PCB
### This is the schematic I designed for my first ever PCB for my FSAE UC Davis Formula 1 Racing Team!
